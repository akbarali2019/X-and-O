# X-and-O
Individual Project at University

In this game, there should be two players: one is for X and the other one is for O. They should put X or O turn by turn, and the first player who can cross 3 Xes or 3 Os diagonally, vertically or horizontally wins the game. Here, the players' logical thinking and a true decision play very important role.
